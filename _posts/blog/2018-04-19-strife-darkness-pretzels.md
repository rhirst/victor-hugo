When I was 5 years old, I saw a bowl of pretzels for the first time.  It wasn't that my family had purposefully denied me of my birth rite for 5 years, no.  More so it was due to the Warstein family yeast shortage that brought strife to our village throughout the 90's.  Pretzels, you see, were a luxury.  

It was only after that first bite, that first tongue-tickling sting of salt, that I truly felt alive.  I had been born again into this dark world, but this time, I had purpose!  The toys of my boyhood seemed to melt from my mind, sliding into the nothingness of nostalgia.  I had no time for childish measures, I had only one love.  Pretzels.
